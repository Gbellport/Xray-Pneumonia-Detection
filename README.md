# Xray-Pneumonia-Detection

Datasets available at: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

Detection of pneumonia from chest x-ray images. Divised a method to reduce resolution of images given too little RAM available in Kaggle kernel, then preprocessed and fed them to a custom CNN. Better results could have been achieved by using a pretrained model (DenseNet or InceptionV3) but was not able to test due to RAM constraints.

**Results:** 
- Accuracy: 81.73%
- Precision: 79.87%
- Recall: 94.62%

**Note:** This notebook was produced within a Kaggle kernel.
